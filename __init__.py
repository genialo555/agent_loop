"""Agent Loop - Autonomous LLM Training & Inference Platform.

This package implements a complete MLOps platform for training, deploying,
and continuously improving autonomous agents powered by Gemma 3N.

The package follows a hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- agent: Agent implementation and tools
- models: ML components (training, inference, datasets)
- infrastructure: Infrastructure as Code
- monitoring: Observability stack
- tests: Test suites
